A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about why a TikTok ban is both a great and bad choice. At the time of the article publishing, it still was not 100% certain if the app was going to be banned or not. However, the night of Jan. 19, TikTok users were greeted with a message that the hit app would indeed be shutting down that night.

At around 10:30 p.m., TikTok was officially banned in the United States. Users could open the app, but were instantly greeted with a message that the app was no longer available for use. Other popular apps also went down with the rest of the ship, these apps include popular video editing apps such as CapCut, Lemon8, even a simple Marvel card game called Marvel Snap.

Some of my close friends who use TikTok saw this as the end of the world. One of my buddies said he “kept opening the app out of habit.” But to me, the world was quiet for a whopping 14 hours before President Trump brought it back online.

While Trump didn’t necessarily “save” TikTok, he gave a 75-day extension to the actual time frame of when the app is set to be banned, leaving it open for another company to buy. While TikTok is technically back, it is still unavailable to download on popular apps stores.
